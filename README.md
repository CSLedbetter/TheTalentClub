The talent club is an application designed for an exclusive membership based application. After user applies to join said club, it sends an email to the admin and upon approval to join, sends an email to the user for payment and access to the clubs website. Payment managed with Stripe, and email services provided with SendGrid.

After cloning of this repository you would need to use a .env file to hold you API keys for Stripe, SendGrid, and any other email addresses you would not like to be published online.

You would then use "npm i" (npm install) and then 'gulp" to start the local server on your machine.
